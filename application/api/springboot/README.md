# Swagger generated API stub

Spring Framework stub

## Overview

This code was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using
the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate an API stub. This is an example
of building API stub interfaces in Java using the Spring framework.
